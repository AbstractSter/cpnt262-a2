### Code Journal
- Friday, October 6th
Felt confused with the syntax and how certain elements were connecting to one another. Watched a number of YouTube videos by the creator "Programming with Mosh" that helped to understand the basic level terminology and processes.

Still having a lot of issues with the assignment and how to get the code to do what I want. I am struggling with the commands and what exactly they are doing when I push them. I am also really struggling with linking the html to the JavaScript file. How should my html page look in order to receive the JavaScript commands. Ultimately, I think going through an online course that allows me to practice along with the content will be helpful. Unfortunately, I feel like I won't have time to go through an online course in addition to my SAIT course load. My goal for this course and for the program as a whole is to get my framework understanding strong and go back once I have my certificate to style my projects to a level that is employable.
